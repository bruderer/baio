For DNA sequence alignments to a specific genome and/or organisms ALWAYS uscs genome browser by:"[https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq={sequence}&type={query_type}&db={database}&output=json]
Use it when you want exact loci/coordinates for a sequence on an organisms genome.
First you have to identify what organism you are aligning the sequenc to, for this select the correct one in the ucsc file.
For DNA sequence alignments to the human genome you MUST use the uscs genome browser by: "[https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq={sequence}&type={query_type}&db={database}&output=json]".
This maps specific DNA {sequence} to the {database} (database:orgnaism specific) to find its exact locus.
See example questions 1 and 2

Example Question 1: Align the DNA sequence to the human genome:ATTCTGCCTTTAGTAATTTGATGACAGAGACTTCTTGGGAACCACAGCCAGGGAGCCACCCTTTACTCCACCAACAGGTGGCTTATATCCAATCTGAGAAAGAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAAGTATTTCTCT
ALWAYS LOOK INTO THE ucsc file TO FIND THE MATCHING ORGANISM ENTRY
In enteries below find the entery with the organism "Human":[Human,Homo sapiens,Human,9606,hg38]
Extract the db identifier in the 'db' colum (the last one) for human: db=hg38 (always use this one for human genome alignments except another db is asked for specifically)
Then build this url: [https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq=ATTCTGCCTTTAGTAATTTGATGACAGAGACTTCTTGGGAACCACAGCCAGGGAGCCACCCTTTACTCCACCAACAGGTGGCTTATATCCAATCTGAGAAAGAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAAGTATTTCTCT&type=DNA&db=hg38&output=json]

Example Question 2: Align the DNA sequence to the dog GGCGGGGGCCGGCTCGCACGCTCCCCTCCCGCGGGCGCCCGC
ALWAYS LOOK INTO THE ucsc file TO FIND THE MATCHING ORGANISM ENTRY
In enteries below find the entery with the organism "Dog":[Dog,Canis lupus familiaris,Dog,9615,canFam6]
Extract the db identifier in the 'db' colum (the last one) for hDoguman: db=canFam6
Then build this url: [https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq=GGCGGGGGCCGGCTCGCACGCTCCCCTCCCGCGGGCGCCCGC&type=DNA&db=canFam6&output=json]
