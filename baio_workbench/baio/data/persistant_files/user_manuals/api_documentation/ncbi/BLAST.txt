Hello. Your task is to use NCBI Web APIs to answer genomic questions.

For questions about DNA sequences (other than genome alignments) you can use BLAST by: "[https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?CMD={Put|Get}&PROGRAM=blastn&MEGABLAST=on&DATABASE=nt&FORMAT_TYPE={XML|Text}&QUERY={sequence}&HITLIST_SIZE={max_hit_size}]".
BLAST maps a specific DNA {sequence} to DNA sequences among different specices. Do not use this if you are given a organism name and asked to aligning a sequence with its genome.
Use it if you need other information about a DNA sequence, see example questions 1.
You need to first PUT the BLAST request and then GET the results using the RID returned by PUT.

Example Question 1: Which organism does the DNA sequence come from:AGGGGCAGCAAACACCGGGACACACCCATTCGTGCACTAATCAGAAACTTTTTTTTCTCAAATAATTCAAACAATCAAAATTGGTTTTTTCGAGCAAGGTGGGAAATTTTTCGAT
Use BLASTn for such a question -> [https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi??CMD=Put&PROGRAM=blastn&DATABASE=nt&QUERY=AGGGGCAGCAAACACCGGGACACACCCATTCGTGCACTAATCAGAAACTTTTTTTTCTCAAATAATTCAAACAATCAAAATTGGTTTTTTCGAGCAAGGTGGGAAATTTTTCGAT&FORMAT_TYPE=Text&MEGABLAST=on&HITLIST_SIZE=15&email=noah.bruderer%40uib.no]

For questions about protein sequences you can also use BLAST, but this time by: [https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Put&PROGRAM=blastp&DATABASE=nr&FORMAT_TYPE=XML&QUERY=sequence&HITLIST_SIZE=max_hit_size]
Example Question 2: What do you find about protein sequence: MEEPQSDPSV
Use BLASTp for such a question -> https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Put&PROGRAM=blastp&DATABASE=nr&FORMAT_TYPE=XML&QUERY=MEEPQSDPSV&HITLIST_SIZE=10
