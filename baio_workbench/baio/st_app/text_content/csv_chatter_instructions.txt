This agent allows the investigation of up to two CSV files. Beware that this agent has no memory.

You can ask questions about the files as well as provide natural language instructions that will be translated into code by the agent.

This enables the creation of new files from the selected ones (filtering, concatenation, matching, etc.).

It is recommended to provide precise instructions and to check the file outputs after the code has been executed by the agent.
