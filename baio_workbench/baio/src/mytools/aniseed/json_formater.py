        To create a flat pandas DataFrame from the JSON structure:
        1. Examine the `base_type`:
        - 'list': DataFrame has rows for each list item.
        - 'dict': DataFrame starts with columns from dictionary keys.
        2. For `key_types`:
        - Key with basic type (e.g., 'str', 'int'): Direct column in DataFrame.
        - Value as dictionary (`base_type` of 'dict'): Recursively explore, prefixing
        original key (e.g., 'genes_gene_model').
        - Avoid adding columns with complex types like lists or dictionaries. Instead,
        break them down to atomic values or omit if not needed.
        3. Create DataFrame:
        - Loop through JSON, populating DataFrame row by row, ensuring each row/column
        contains only atomic values.
        - Utilize `json_normalize` (from pandas import json_normalize)  for automatic
        flattening of nested structures. But ensure no columns with complex types
        remain.
        Note: Adjust based on specific nuances in the actual JSON data. Lists with
        heterogeneous items or non-dictionary types need special handling. Avoid
        creating DataFrame columns with non-atomic data.
